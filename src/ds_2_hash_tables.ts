// Hash table - is a data structure that uses hash functions to map keys to values of array for quick access.

// Hash function - is a function that takes an input and returns a fixed-size number.
// Hash functions are used in hash tables, to quickly locate a data record (e.g., a dictionary definition) given its search key (the headword).
// Hash function has to be deterministic - for a given input it should always return the same output.

// Hash table collisions - are when two keys get mapped to the same index in an array.
